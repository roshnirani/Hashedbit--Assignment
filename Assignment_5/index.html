<!-- Task Statement

the program would generate a random number every time we click a button and display that number. So let's learn to do that. You can use Math.random() for the generation of Random numbers.
Make a p tag with id="main" and content I am learning to generate random number. I will be able to handle randomness in any of my applications that needs it. Press the button to get a random number.
Make a button with id="btn" which on click renders a random whole number each time between -20 & 20.
Make a p tag with id="num" where the random number is rendered. Initially, the p tag should contain an empty string.
Note: The random number generated must be between 20 and -20, and should be a whole number. If it is in decimal, make sure to round it off.
